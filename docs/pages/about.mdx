# About this Styleguide

## Purpose

Why are we even doing this?

## Content Outline (Draft)

### UX Guidelines

Why and how are we doing things. Documentation of principles and guidelines for design and code.

#### Design

- «Art Direction» for Product, not just Magazine
  - We do this in-house, find & build competence in tech team
- Design System: visually and written documentation but also as code
  - Spacing
  - Colors
  - Type
  - Layout
  - Fluid vs. responsive
  - Animation
- Accessibility built-in
  - Contrast
  - Font sizes
- Practice, Testing, Tools

#### Tech

- Accessibility built-in
  - Semantics first
  - CSS
  - Keyboard navigation
  - As little JS as needed (”progressive enhancement”)
  - ARIA if necessary
  - Alternative content (image alt text etc.)
- Inclusive Design > Accessibility
  - Perspectives, not disabilities
- Build for preference
  - Light/dark mode
  - High contrast?
- Performance
  - Ship less JS
  - Compress images
  - Resist adding complexity just because it's easy to do
- UI Language, wording, copy
- Practices, Testing, Tools
- UI Component catalog (Documentation & Code)

### Design System

Reference for most basic implementation of the principles, design tokens with code snippets.

- Layout
  - Fluid Layout (e.g. [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/))
- Design Token Tables (e.g. [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens/colors))
  - Color Palettes (e.g. [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/palette-composition/the-scales))
  - Type Tables (e.g. [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/), [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/packages/style-guide))
  - Layout Table (e.g. [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/grid/calculator))
  - Spacing Tables (e.g. [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator/))
  - Icons (e.g. [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/components/icon/icon-explorer), [Radix Icons](https://icons.radix-ui.com/))

### Component Library

- Meta: Deprecated/Stability Index
- Structure by package
- Usage

- Prop/API Reference Tables (e.g. [Radix Documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog#api-reference), [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/dialog/), [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/callout-card), [Primer](https://primer.style/react/ActionMenu#props))
- Component Demos (e.g. [Radix Documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/dialog)), responsive iframes

- Versioning?

#### Patterns

- Compositions that go beyond basic components
