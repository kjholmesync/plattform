# Avatar

This is just a demo to show that we can import packages with TSX and [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) directly 🎉

<CodeDemo file='demos/avatar.tsx' />

☝️ this was done using the `CodeDemo` component, like so:

```tsx
<CodeDemo file='demos/avatar.tsx' />
```
