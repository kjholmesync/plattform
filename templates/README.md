# Package templates

> This folder contains a bunch of packages that
> act as templates when creating new packages for specific
> purposes.

The current templates are:
- frontend-package (package with a JS/TS/React.js/JEST test setup)

When creating new packages from the templates, simply copy the folder, rename the package in the package.json and you're good to go.
