## Build & Dev Scripts

The build-script consists of two commands:

1. Using `svgr` the svg-files are converted into React-components (outputted into `lib/components`)

2. In a second step `vite.js` is used to bundle the output of the previous step as a CSJ & ESM bundle. In addtion the type-descriptions are generated as well.

The dev-script uses `nodemon` to watch the `lib/svg` folder. If a change is detected, the build-script is re-run.

## Adding an icon

To add an icon, simply add a `.svg` file into the `lib/svg` folder.
